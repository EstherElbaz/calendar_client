# 🗓️ Calendar Client – React App

A clean and minimalistic frontend built in React, designed to complement the Calendar Backend system.  
This application provides a smooth user experience for managing calendar events, including user authentication and full event control.

## 🌟 Features

- **User authentication** – registration & login flow  
- **Event display** – view events by **month**, **week**, or **day**  
- **Event management** – add, edit, and delete events  
- **Responsive and clear UI** – minimalistic design focused on usability  
- **Integrated with backend API** – works seamlessly with the [Calendar Backend](https://github.com/EstherElbaz/calendar-server)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (with hooks and functional components)  
- **React Router** – for navigation between views  
- **Fetch API** – used for communicating with the backend  
- **CSS** – simple styling for clean layout  
- **Native JavaScript Date handling**

## 🔗 Backend Integration

This frontend connects to a custom [Node.js + Express backend](https://github.com/EstherElbaz/calendar-server), which supports:

- User registration and login using JWT  
- Event CRUD functionality  
- MongoDB for data persistence  
- Full layered architecture (routes, controllers, services, and models)

## ✅ Highlights

- Built using clean and readable code practices  
- Simple but effective user flow  
- Project demonstrates full-stack implementation from frontend to backend  
- Great starting point for further enhancements (UI improvements, state management with context, etc.)
